# Fruit Price Rebalance Mod for Stardew Valley v1.5

This project is a small but impactful modification for Stardew Valley, designed to rebalance the prices of fruits and fruit-based products. By fine-tuning the in-game economy, the mod provides a more rewarding experience for players focused on orchard farming and artisan goods production.

## Features

- Adjusted prices for fruits, fruit tree products, and fruit-based artisan goods (e.g., jams, wines, juices).
- Aims to create a more balanced in-game economy without breaking the progression system.
- Built to integrate seamlessly with existing gameplay mechanics.

## Technical Overview

This mod was created using the following tools:
- **[SMAPI (Stardew Modding API)](https://smapi.io/)** for modding support and integration.
- **[Content Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915)** to dynamically apply price adjustments.

These tools enable a loosely coupled modding approach, allowing me to create the mod by writing configuration files instead of directly modifying the C# source code. However, the project still involved research of the game's existing codebase, scripting configuration files, and rigorous manual testing to ensure compatibility and balance.

## Reflection

I developed this project very early in my coding journey. Despite involving very few lines of code, it taught me:
- How to understand, modify and interact with massive existing codebases.
- Modding tools, libraries and APIs.
- User-focused design and how to publish software online.
